                <p>
                    For my M.Sc. in Interactive Digital Media at Trinity College Dublin I worked on a three month 
                    research project which explored the realms of digital media. My group decided to create an interactive 
                    installation which used the user's body as a controller
                    through motion sensor technology. We called it Planet Sustainability.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Planet Sustainability is an interactive installation made with the Unreal Engine 5 game development engine.
                    The project aims to create an experience which engages and educates the user on the topic of Environmentalism
                    in daily choices.
                </p>    
                <p>   You experience the installation from a first-person perspective, navigating the 3D worlds we made 
                      with your body using the Microsoft Kinect as a controller (with a traditional input method such as Keyboard 
                      and mouse also supported). The installation features 4-way surround sound for audio using mounted speakers
                       on stands and a 1080p projector to display the video output.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal here is a covid conscious experience that is fun, immersive, engaging and educational. The 3D-conscious audio design,
                     impressive graphics, and body controls make the project unique.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My role in this project was varied as I dabbled accross project management, 3D graphics and programming. I created many 3D models for this project and textured them. 
                    I created audio FX, sourced audio FX and created all music myself for this project.
                </p>
                <p> I assisted in programming with certain events and helped our lead programmer, who developed the majority of the softwareâ€™s logic, with his work as much as I could.
                    Most of my work consisted of scripted NPC AI logic.
                     I wrote the entirety of the contextual/ story aspect of the software. I researched environmental relevant information. 
                     I also assisted with management at points of the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <b> research project</b> was shown to the public in the Science Galery 
                    at the heart of Dublin's city centre.
