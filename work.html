                    The course is designed to help students learn how to design, 
                    develop and understand digital media applications and content 
                    on existing and emerging platforms. The course covers the programming
                    languages and applications used in digital media, a range of design 
                    techniques (graphic design, interactive design, UI/UX design, game design)
                     as well as approaches to content creation in a range of modalities 
                     (moving image, audio, sensor technologies).  In addition to practical 
                     skills, the course also covers critical thinking around digital media, 
                     giving the students the ability to situate works and ideas in relevant 
                     cultural contexts.

         Information plays a key role in all aspects of life - 
         in business, government, society and the life of the
          individual. Knowing how to create, manage, share,
           find and use digital information is more relevant 
           than ever before. Information Technology studies
            gave me the chance to explore the ways companies such 
            as Facebook, Twitter, Intel, Google and Apple utilise 
            the interplay of people, information, technology and 
            social structures to succeed in today's digital world.
            Information & Social Computing is relevant for careers in: 
            Web design and development, Social media, Social computing,
             User experience design, Investigative research, Publishing,
              Digital marketing, Business.
